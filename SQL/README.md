### Covid Data Exploration
In this personal project, I'm using MySQL queries to conduct detailed analyses of COVID-19 data. I'm exploring various aspects such as death percentages, infection rates compared to population, and vaccination progress at both country and continent levels. 

### NashVille data cleaning
In this data cleaning process for the Nashville dataset, I standardized date formats, populated missing property addresses by copying from related records, and split address information into separate columns for better organization. Additionally, I transformed 'Y' and 'N' values in the 'SoldAsVacant' column and removed duplicate records and unused columns to streamline the dataset for further analysis.
